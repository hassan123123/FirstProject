I'm stuck in updating the list of fooditems to cloud firestore, The class BottomBarState in the file models/cart.dart consist of an InkWell widget, I want to update the data which is present in cart to the firestore, the data in the cart consist of of a list of fooditems where each fooditem has it's own attributes, I want to create a document for each fooditem in the list and it will consist their attributes.
